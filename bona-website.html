            <h2>Bona Cafe and Market Website</h2>
            <p>A web development course project focused on creating the website for Bona Cafe, a local Vancouver
                business.
            </p>
        </section>
        <div class="hero-img">
            <img src="imgs/bona-landing.png" alt="Bona market and cafe" width="2936" height="1818">
        </div>

        <section class="bona-research">
            <h2>Initial Research</h2>
            <p> Examined precedents from other local businesses in the same space and identified commonalities between
                each website to incorporate into our design.</p>

            <ul>
                <li> Large images on the landing page</li>
                <li>Photo-focused menus</li>
                <li>Hours and addresses included in the footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After looking at the research we were able to determine what the goal was for the Bona Cafe website.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>To create a website that is functional, accessible, and responsive while also feeling familiar to
                users and maintaining a unique style specific to Bona cafe.</p>

            <h2>What I did</h2>
            <h3>Translating the design files into functional code</h3>
            <p>As my partner concentrated more on the design aspects, I took the lead in developing the more complex and
                structured pages. This involved carefully reviewing the design files and asking clarifying questions
                about layout spacing, component states, and interactive elements. My goal was to ensure that the final
                website matched the intended visual direction and that everything translated smoothly into code. This
                approach helped me break the design into modular, manageable pieces for development. </p>
            <h3>Creating responsive components</h3>
            <div class="bona-role-grid">
                <img src="imgs/bona-responsive.png" alt="Bona cafe website menu" width="2867" height="1789">
                <img src="imgs/bona-responsive2.png" alt="Bona cafe website footer" width="2864" height="1810">
            </div>
            <p>I designed the navigation bar and footer shown above, ensuring they adhere to accessibility best
                practices and responsive design principles for optimal performance across various screens and user
                demographics.</p>
            <h3>Troubleshooting and debugging</h3>
            <p>After critique and feedback sessions, I reviewed the project files to ensure alignment with modern best
                practices and addressed any issues raised by peers or my instructor. I also resolved debugging problems
                and handled troubleshooting throughout the project.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Overall, this project taught me a great deal about the design-to-development process and strengthened my
                ability to collaborate with a designer. I learned the importance of clear communication to ensure that
                the visual direction is clear and accurately translates onto the web. I also reinforced my ability to
                code with responsiveness and accessibility at the forefront.</p>
